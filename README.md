# Movie Rental Database
As technology continues to advance, there has never been a better time to automate business processes. 
Traditionally, records of stocks and business transactions have been done manually with the aid of papers which in time has lead to a lot of paper work and more time to perform duties.
A movie rental business owner has similar problems as outlined above and wants to reduce business turn-around-time as well as automating the business.
This app is a solution to that problem. With the aid of MongoDB as database and nodejs, the movie rental business has been automated and allows the user to add(Create), read(Read), update(Update), and delete(Delete) movies inthe database.
